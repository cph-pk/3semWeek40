Here is the link for the backend from **Thursdays** exercise. 

[Link to `Backend` API](https://cphper.dk/cors/)
#### How to use API in backend:
The following should be added after `cphper.dk/cors/`  
Add `api/cors/count` to see how many records in total.  
Add `api/cors/all` to see all records.  
Add `api/cors/` + a number`{id}` for one record.
